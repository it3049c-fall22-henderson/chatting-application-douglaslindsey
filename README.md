## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

## Self-Reflection:
I learned a lot about how Github repositories work. I still was having trouble hosting pages. I spent a LOT of time trying to figure that out, as well and learned about implementing JS into HTML.

### How long it took me to finish this?
Roughly 4-5 hours. I was having quite a bit of trouble getting started as some of the filler code didn't make sense.
It started to come together after that though.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
It is a slightly larger display header, and 4 means it is smaller than 1-3.
